## üìÑ Overview
Thyroid nodules are common clinical findings, and distinguishing benign from malignant nodules is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict thyroid nodule malignancy based on clinical ultrasound and laboratory features.  

The analysis demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline including **data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization**. Models include **K-Means Clustering, Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Network (MLPClassifier)**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
- **Source:** Clinical ultrasound and laboratory data of thyroid nodules  
- **Features:** Shape, Calcification, Echo Pattern, Size, Composition, Margin  
- **Goal:** Predict whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Imported, normalized, and standardized clinical features  
   - Removed non-essential identifiers (e.g., patient ID)  
   - Addressed feature scaling for proper convergence  

2. **Feature Selection:**  
   Clinically relevant features were chosen for modeling:  

   | Feature      | Type       | Description |
   |-------------|------------|-------------|
   | Shape       | Binary     | Irregular shapes indicate malignancy |
   | Calcification | Binary   | Microcalcifications are strong cancer indicators |
   | Echo Pattern | Binary    | Uneven texture (hypoechoic) correlates with malignancy |
   | Size        | Continuous | Larger nodules tend to be more suspicious |
   | Composition | Categorical | Solid nodules carry higher malignancy risk |
   | Margin      | Binary     | Irregular margins imply invasive growth |

3. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - **K-Means Clustering:** Unsupervised clustering (k=2) with evaluation via ARI and silhouette score.  
   - **Random Forest Classifier:** Supervised ensemble model with feature importance ranking.  
   - **Neural Network (MLPClassifier):** Two hidden layers, logistic activation, Adam optimizer, L2 regularization.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy  
   - ROC-AUC  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix and feature importance visualization
